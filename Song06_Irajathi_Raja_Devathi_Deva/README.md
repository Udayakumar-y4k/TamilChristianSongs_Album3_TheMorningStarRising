This intimate worship song confesses Jesus as the supreme King and Redeemer who never abandons His own. From the orphan lifted from the mire to the lost sheep found and cherished, from the weary heart given rest to the sinner restored — every verse proclaims His unmatched love and saving power. He alone is worthy of all praise.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, King of kings and Redeemer,
thank You for finding us when we were lost.
Lift us, hold us, restore us.
Be our everything forever.
We worship You alone.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
