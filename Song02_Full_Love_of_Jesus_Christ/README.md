This tender song expresses complete trust in Jesus’ abiding presence and coming return. When He is with us, there is no worry; when He comes, we wait with joy through the night. He is our God, our life, our way, truth, life — everything. His blood cleanses, His love fills, and He alone is enough.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, our everything,
be with us now and come quickly.
Let us know no worry in Your presence.
Fill us with Your full love.
You are enough — forever.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
