This majestic call to worship echoes Deborah’s victory song (Judges 5) and Moses’ final song (Deuteronomy 32). Kings and rulers are summoned to listen as creation itself testifies: earth quakes, heavens pour, mountains melt before the Lord’s presence. He is the Rock — perfect, just, faithful. His Word falls like dew. The song proclaims His unchanging name and calls all creation to praise.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord God Almighty, the Rock eternal,
let kings and rulers hear Your voice today.
Let earth and heaven proclaim Your name.
Melt every mountain of pride before You.
We worship You — faithful and true forever.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
