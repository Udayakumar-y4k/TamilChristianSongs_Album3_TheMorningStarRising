This triumphant song of deliverance echoes Miriam’s victory dance after the Red Sea (Exodus 15:20–21) and David’s joyful worship before the ark (2 Samuel 6). From Pharaoh’s defeat to the final crushing of enemies, every victory is the Lord’s alone. We follow Him with harps and dance, proclaiming “Victory!” — for He is our strength and salvation.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, Victor over every enemy,
lead us in Your triumph.
Let us follow You with harps and dance.
Make us dwell in Your presence forever.
We praise You — our King of victory.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
