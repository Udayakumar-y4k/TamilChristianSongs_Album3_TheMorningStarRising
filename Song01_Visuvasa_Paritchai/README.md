This song is a bold call to endure the test of faith that Jesus Himself conducts in our lives. From creation to salvation, from deliverance to the gift of the Spirit, every work is by Him alone. We live by His breath, worship by His grace, and await His return — declaring with joy: “Jesus is enough!”
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, Tester and Perfecter of our faith,
lead us through every trial with victory.
Let us live by Your breath alone.
Be enough for us in every season.
Come quickly, our Alpha and Omega.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
