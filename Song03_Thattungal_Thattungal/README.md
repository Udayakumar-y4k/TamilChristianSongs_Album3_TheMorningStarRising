This joyful call to persistent prayer echoes Luke 11:9 — Jesus’ promise that asking, seeking, and knocking will be answered. From early morning hallelujahs to proclaiming His name town to town, from the miracle of feeding five thousand to the hope of reigning with Him a thousand years — the song urges bold, continual prayer rooted in His finished work on the cross.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, the Open Door,
teach us to knock without ceasing.
Answer every cry with Your presence.
Feed us with living bread.
Prepare us to reign with You.
We look only to You.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
